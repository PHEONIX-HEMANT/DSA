What is hamiltonian path?

Hamiltonian Path is a path starting from a vertex, which travels through all the vertices exactly once.
In other words, hamiltonian path is a sequence of vertices such that there exists an edge between a vertex and its adjacent in the sequence.

There can be multiple hamiltonian paths in a graph.
